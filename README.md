PolyPainter
- thanks to Sidar for initial version - from which this is modified towards my full needs on Trilateral, and the lovely rose img.
- subject to change when explored real use cases.
[polypainter test](https://nanjizal.github.io/PolyPainter/build/html5/index.html) ( could create more interesting demo ).
